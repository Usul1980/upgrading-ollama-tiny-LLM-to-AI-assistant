# upgrading-ollama-tiny-LLM-to-add-hearing-and-speech
<i>by adding listening and text to speech (tts) to the ollama framework</i>

This coding project merely adds the ability to speak to the (tiny) LLM in the ollama framework and also gets the answer to be spoken back to you, as if you were conversing with another human! 

If you havent already, you can install ollama on your windows PC with this link:

If you want to give it a whirl, open command prompt and run 

`ollama run tinyllama`

That will pull the tinyllama package and also run it once its finished. For more variety to choose from click here:

You can then give it a question and see what it comes back with.

When you are ready, open the jupyter notebook called 'voice project' and run through it. Should be pretty straightforward.
